**Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.**

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap and Dependencies
- **Node.js Setup**: `node --version` (requires v14+, tested with v20.19.4)
- **Install dependencies**: `npm install --include=optional` NEVER CANCEL.
- **Sharp dependency fix**: If hexify fails with sharp errors, run: `npm install sharp --include=optional`

### Asset Processing
- **Process hex tiles**: `npm run hexify` -- takes < 1 second. Creates 297 hex tiles from source PNG files. NEVER CANCEL.
- **Alternative**: `node hexify-sharp.js` (same result, same timing)
- **Asset verification**: `find assets/hex_tiles -name "*.png" | wc -l` should return exactly 297
- **Processing speed**: Very fast (~0.2s), no timeout needed

### Running the Application
- **Start local server**: `python3 -m http.server 8080` or any HTTP server on port 8080. NEVER CANCEL.
- **Access main game**: http://localhost:8080/
- **Battle system tests**: http://localhost:8080/test_battle_system.html

### CDN Dependencies Issue
- **CRITICAL**: External CDN dependencies (Phaser.js, SimplexNoise) may be blocked in some environments
- **Main app failure**: If console shows "Phaser is not defined", CDN access is blocked
- **Workaround needed**: Download dependencies to `lib/` directory and update index.html script paths
- **Download commands** (if internet access available):
  ```bash
  mkdir -p lib
  wget -O lib/phaser.js "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/phaser@3.60.0/dist/phaser.js"
  wget -O lib/simplex-noise.min.js "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/simplex-noise@2.4.0/simplex-noise.min.js"
  ```

## Validation

### Battle System Validation (Always Works)
- **Test URL**: http://localhost:8080/test_battle_system.html
- **Expected result**: All 9 tests pass (‚úÖ green checkmarks) - see screenshot for reference
- **Test coverage**: BattleData, BattleResolver, BattleManager, BattleInterface classes
- **Validation time**: 2-3 seconds
- **Success indicators**: 
  - "üéØ Battle System Test Complete" heading
  - "All battle system components are properly loaded and functional for AdminPanel testing"
  - No red ‚ùå failure indicators

### Main Application Validation (CDN Dependent)
- **Test URL**: http://localhost:8080/
- **Success indicators**: Game canvas loads, no "Phaser is not defined" errors
- **Failure indicators**: Console errors about blocked CDN resources
- **Manual testing**: Click and drag to pan map, use admin panel (if accessible)

### Asset Processing Validation
- **Command**: `npm run hexify && find assets/hex_tiles -name "*.png" | wc -l`
- **Expected output**: 297 PNG files
- **Time**: Under 1 second

## Development Vision & Roadmap

### Game Design Philosophy
SimulationJS is designed as a **deep, strategic hex-based civilization game** that emphasizes:

**üéØ Core Design Pillars**
- **Strategic Depth**: Complex interconnected systems (units, buildings, resources, terrain, combat)
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Player decisions create unique strategic situations through system interactions
- **Accessible Complexity**: Deep mechanics with intuitive interfaces and clear feedback
- **Modular Architecture**: Each system (battle, buildings, units, persistence) operates independently but integrates seamlessly

**üåç World Simulation Focus**
- **Living World**: Dynamic resource generation, unit movement, building production cycles
- **Persistent State**: Full world state preservation across sessions via multiple storage backends
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports expansion from small maps to large civilizations

### Architecture Patterns to Follow

**üèóÔ∏è Modular System Design**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each system (battle/, buildings/, units/, ui/, persistence/) has clear boundaries
- **Data-Driven Configuration**: All game content defined in config.js with asset lists and constants
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Systems communicate through Phaser events, not direct coupling
- **Interface Standardization**: Common patterns for UI components (BaseModal, resource costs, admin controls)

**üîÑ Integration Patterns**
- **Manager Classes**: BattleManager, UIManager coordinate between systems
- **Shared State**: GameWorld.js provides central state management for map and global data
- **Component-Based UI**: Reusable UI components with consistent styling and behavior
- **Asset Pipeline**: Centralized hex tile processing through hexify-sharp.js

**‚ö° Performance Guidelines**
- **Efficient Rendering**: Hex grid optimized for Phaser.js with minimal draw calls
- **Smart Updates**: Only update UI/state when necessary (tick-based simulation)
- **Memory Management**: Reuse objects where possible, avoid frequent allocation/deallocation

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.js         # Shared utilities, math helpers
```

**üéØ When Adding New Features**
1. **Start with config.js**: Define constants, assets, and balance values
2. **Create core logic**: Implement system in appropriate directory (battle/, buildings/, etc.)
3. **Add UI components**: Create interfaces following BaseModal patterns
4. **Integrate with AdminPanel**: Add testing/debugging controls
5. **Update persistence**: Ensure new features save/load correctly
6. **Add validation**: Create tests following battle system test patterns

**üîó Integration Guidelines**
- **UI Integration**: All game systems should have admin panel controls for testing
- **Event System**: Use Phaser.Events for system communication
- **State Management**: Store persistent data in appropriate manager classes
- **Asset Management**: All visual assets processed through hex tile pipeline
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites like battle system for major features

### Technical Debt & Maintenance

**üîß Current Technical Debt**
- CDN dependencies create environment setup complexity
- No automated testing framework (manual testing only)
- Asset processing requires manual hexify runs
- Limited error handling in cross-system integrations

**üéØ Maintenance Priorities**
1. **Dependency Management**: Move to local bundling to eliminate CDN issues
2. **Test Coverage**: Expand automated testing beyond battle system
3. **Build Pipeline**: Automate asset processing and deployment
4. **Error Handling**: Improve graceful degradation when systems fail
5. **Documentation**: Maintain this roadmap as features are implemented

### Contributing Guidelines

**‚úÖ Code Quality Standards**
- Follow existing patterns in each system directory
- Maintain separation between game logic and UI code
- Use descriptive variable names and clear function signatures
- Comment complex algorithms and system interactions
- Validate changes against battle system test patterns

**üöÄ Feature Development Process**
1. **Design First**: Consider how new feature fits into existing systems
2. **Start Small**: Implement minimal viable version first
3. **Test Early**: Create validation (manual or automated) immediately
4. **Integrate Gradually**: Connect to UI, persistence, and other systems
5. **Document Changes**: Update this roadmap when major features complete

This roadmap ensures all code contributions align with SimulationJS's vision of a deep, modular strategy game while maintaining technical excellence and player experience quality.
