# AI Strategy Behaviors and Advanced Decision Making

## Overview
This document outlines advanced AI behaviors and strategic decision-making systems for SimulationJS AI players. The goal is to create AI that can "think ahead" and pursue complex, multi-step objectives.

## Core Strategic Thinking Framework

### Resource Planning System
AI should maintain awareness of:
- **Current Resources**: What they have now
- **Resource Flow**: Production rates and consumption
- **Resource Needs**: What they need for upcoming goals
- **Resource Bottlenecks**: Which resources limit their plans

### Strategic State Tracking
```javascript
aiState: {
  currentPhase: 'early_expansion', // early_expansion, mid_game, late_game, war_economy
  primaryGoal: 'establish_economy',
  resourcePriorities: ['wood', 'stone', 'food'],
  plannedBuildings: [
    { type: 'LumberCamp', priority: 'high', blockedBy: ['wood:50', 'stone:30'] },
    { type: 'Barracks', priority: 'medium', blockedBy: ['wood:250', 'stone:150'] }
  ],
  strategicNeeds: {
    'increase_military': { requiresFirst: ['establish_barracks', 'increase_population'] },
    'expand_territory': { requiresFirst: ['military_security', 'resource_surplus'] }
  }
}
```

## Strategic Behavior Archetypes

### 1. The Methodical Planner
**Philosophy**: "Slow and steady wins the race"
- Always ensures 2x resource requirements before starting projects
- Plans 3-4 buildings ahead
- Builds redundant resource sources
- Avoids military conflict until economically dominant

**Decision Tree Example**:
```
"I want to build a Barracks (250w, 150s)"
→ "Current: 180w, 100s - Not enough"
→ "I need more wood generation first"
→ "LumberCamp costs 150w, 80s (scaled)"
→ "I can afford that now, but will need stone after"
→ "Build Quarry first (80w, 150s), then LumberCamp"
```

### 2. The Opportunistic Rusher
**Philosophy**: "Strike while the iron is hot"
- Builds minimum viable economy
- Rushes military production
- Takes calculated risks
- Exploits enemy weaknesses immediately

**Advanced Behaviors**:
- Scouts enemy positions to identify weak spots
- Times attacks during enemy building phases
- Sacrifices long-term economy for short-term military advantage

### 3. The Adaptive Survivor
**Philosophy**: "Respond to threats, capitalize on opportunities"
- Continuously analyzes all players' strategies
- Shifts strategy based on external pressure
- Maintains balanced development until threats emerge
- Can switch from economic to military focus rapidly

### 4. The Economic Powerhouse
**Philosophy**: "Control the resources, control the game"
- Focuses exclusively on resource production
- Builds diverse resource portfolio
- Uses economic leverage for diplomacy
- Delays military until overwhelming economic advantage

### 5. The Territorial Expansionist
**Philosophy**: "Space is power"
- Prioritizes claiming strategic locations
- Builds outposts and defensive structures
- Focuses on controlling resource-rich areas
- Uses geography as force multiplier

## Advanced Decision Making Systems

### Multi-Step Planning
AI should think in terms of build orders and prerequisites:

```javascript
goalAnalysis: {
  goal: 'build_strong_military',
  steps: [
    { action: 'build_barracks', cost: {wood:250, stone:150}, requires: ['adequate_stone_income'] },
    { action: 'increase_stone_income', requires: ['build_quarry'] },
    { action: 'build_quarry', cost: {wood:80, stone:150}, requires: ['adequate_wood_income'] },
    { action: 'increase_wood_income', requires: ['build_lumber_camp'] },
    { action: 'build_lumber_camp', cost: {wood:150, stone:80}, requires: ['current_resources'] }
  ],
  totalCost: {wood:480, stone:380},
  currentResources: {wood:200, stone:100},
  gap: {wood:280, stone:280},
  timeEstimate: '12 ticks at current production rate'
}
```

### Resource Flow Modeling
AI tracks production vs consumption over time:

```javascript
resourceModel: {
  wood: {
    production: 15, // per tick from 3 lumber camps
    consumption: 5, // ongoing upkeep and construction
    netFlow: 10,
    projectedIn5Ticks: currentAmount + (netFlow * 5)
  }
}
```

### Dynamic Priority Adjustment
Priorities shift based on game state:

```javascript
priorityAdjustments: [
  {
    condition: 'enemy_military_spotted_nearby',
    adjustments: { military: +2, economic: -1 }
  },
  {
    condition: 'resources_below_threshold',
    adjustments: { resource_gathering: +3, military: -1 }
  },
  {
    condition: 'population_cap_reached',
    adjustments: { population_buildings: +2, training: -1 }
  }
]
```

## Specific Strategic Behaviors

### Early Game (0-50 ticks)
- **Resource Assessment**: Scan nearby tiles for resource availability
- **Foundation Building**: Prioritize basic resource gatherers
- **Efficiency Focus**: Build only necessary buildings
- **Scout Preparation**: Plan for future expansion while securing base

### Mid Game (50-150 ticks)
- **Economic Scaling**: Double resource production capacity
- **Military Foundation**: Begin military building construction
- **Territory Expansion**: Claim strategic resource points
- **Threat Assessment**: Monitor enemy development closely

### Late Game (150+ ticks)
- **Power Projection**: Build advanced military units
- **Economic Warfare**: Disrupt enemy resource flows
- **Strategic Superiority**: Leverage accumulated advantages
- **Victory Push**: Execute coordinated campaign for dominance

## Interaction Systems

### Diplomacy Considerations
Even in combat-focused scenarios, AI should consider:
- **Alliance Value**: Is cooperation more beneficial than conflict?
- **Threat Assessment**: Which players pose the greatest danger?
- **Resource Trading**: Can resource exchange benefit both parties?
- **Non-Aggression Pacts**: Strategic temporary truces during expansion

### Information Warfare
Advanced AI tracks and responds to:
- **Scout Reports**: What has been discovered about enemies?
- **Build Pattern Recognition**: What strategy are opponents using?
- **Resource Flow Analysis**: Which enemies are resource-constrained?
- **Timing Windows**: When are enemies most vulnerable?

## Implementation Architecture

### State Machine Components
```javascript
AIBrain: {
  strategicPlanner: new StrategicPlanner(player, gameState),
  resourceAnalyst: new ResourceAnalyst(player, gameState),
  threatAssessment: new ThreatAssessment(gameState, allPlayers),
  buildOrderManager: new BuildOrderManager(strategicPlanner),
  tacticalExecutor: new TacticalExecutor(player, currentOrders)
}
```

### Decision Update Loop
1. **Assess Current State**: Resources, buildings, units, threats
2. **Update Strategic Goals**: Adjust based on new information
3. **Plan Build Orders**: Calculate optimal sequence for goals
4. **Resource Gap Analysis**: Identify what's needed vs. available
5. **Priority Adjustment**: Weight immediate vs. long-term needs
6. **Action Selection**: Choose single best action for this tick
7. **Execution**: Attempt the selected action
8. **Result Evaluation**: Learn from success/failure

## Specific Scenario Examples

### "I Need More Stone for Military"
```javascript
Current: { wood: 300, stone: 50, goal: 'build_barracks' }
Barracks Cost: { wood: 250, stone: 150 } (scaled)
Analysis: "I have enough wood but need 100 more stone"
Solution Path:
1. Check current Quarry production: +5 stone/tick
2. Time to 150 stone: (150-50)/5 = 20 ticks
3. Alternative: Build second Quarry (-80w, -150s initial, +5s/tick ongoing)
4. Decision: "Build Quarry now, wait 20 ticks, then build Barracks"
```

### "Enemy Military Approaching"
```javascript
Threat Level: HIGH
Current Military: 2 units
Enemy Military: 5 units approaching in 8 ticks
Strategic Options:
1. Emergency military production (if Barracks available)
2. Defensive building construction (walls, towers)  
3. Economic warfare (raid enemy resource buildings)
4. Strategic withdrawal (move units to safety)
5. Diplomatic solution (request alliance from other players)
Decision: Combine defensive building + request help from strongest player
```

### "Resource Abundance Management"
```javascript
Current: { wood: 1000, stone: 800, food: 600 }
Analysis: "Stockpile too large, inefficient"
Strategic Response:
1. Accelerate building construction (multiple simultaneous projects)
2. Military unit production burst
3. Territorial expansion (claim distant resource points)
4. Advanced building construction (expensive but powerful structures)
Decision: "Build 3 military buildings simultaneously, prepare for expansion"
```

This framework provides AI players with sophisticated strategic thinking capabilities that mirror human decision-making processes, creating more engaging and unpredictable gameplay experiences.
